# A/B Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds A/B testing capabilities to the Lecca.io platform, allowing users to split traffic between multiple paths based on configurable percentages.

## Files Changed

1. **New Files:**
   - `/packages/apps/src/lib/flow-control/actions/ab-test.action.ts` - Core logic for the A/B testing action
   - `/packages/apps/src/lib/flow-control/actions/ab-test.test.ts` - Unit tests for the A/B testing action
   - `/packages/ui/src/pages/projects/components/workflow/nodes/action-node/builder/ab-test-paths-form-fields.tsx` - UI component for configuring A/B test paths
   - `/packages/apps/src/lib/flow-control/docs/ab-testing.md` - Documentation for the A/B testing feature

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `/packages/apps/src/lib/flow-control/flow-control.app.ts` - Added the A/B testing action to the flow control app
   - `/packages/ui/src/pages/projects/components/workflow/nodes/action-node/builder/dynamic-form-field.tsx` - Added support for the 'ab-test-paths' input type
   - `/packages/ui/src/models/workflow/input-config-model.ts` - Added 'ab-test-paths' to the list of unique input types
   - `/packages/toolkit/src/lib/types/input-config.types.ts` - Added 'ab-test-paths' to the list of input types

## Implementation Details

### A/B Test Action

The A/B test action:
- Generates a random number between 0 and 100
- Determines which path to take based on the configured percentages
- Validates that percentages sum to 100%
- Supports any number of variants

### UI Component

The A/B test paths form component:
- Displays a tab for each connected path
- Provides sliders for adjusting percentages
- Shows total percentage and validates it equals 100%
- Offers a "Distribute Remaining" button for easy configuration
- Updates in real-time as paths are connected or disconnected

## Design Decisions

1. **Percentage-Based Splitting:**
   - Used percentages (0-100%) instead of ratios for user-friendly configuration
   - Implemented validation to ensure percentages sum to 100%

2. **UI Experience:**
   - Created a tabbed interface similar to conditional paths for consistency
   - Added sliders for intuitive percentage adjustment
   - Provided immediate feedback on total percentage

3. **Implementation Approach:**
   - Reused patterns from the conditional paths feature where possible
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for reliability
   - Created documentation for users and developers

## Future Enhancements

1. **Results Tracking:**
   - Add functionality to track and analyze results of A/B tests
   - Provide visualizations of performance metrics

2. **Automatic Optimization:**
   - Implement automatic percentage adjustments based on performance
   - Add multi-armed bandit algorithms for optimizing traffic allocation

3. **Advanced Configuration:**
   - Support user segmentation for targeted testing
   - Allow scheduling of percentage changes over time
